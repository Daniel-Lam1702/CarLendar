# CarLendar App (Still in progress)
# This application is going to be developed in python flask, mysql, and react native. This is a full-stack project developed only by me.
# The application will contain these features:
#   - Calendar for car maintainance: The application will send reminders to the user about new changes or inspections they have to do to their car
#   - Forum for other owners of the same make of car who can interact with each other in case they are looking for some help and recommendations on what to do with their cars.
# What I have developed so far:
#   - The REST api in python flask for the Car, User, and Post model. They will be more developed once I develop a demo frontend.
#   - An internal database in mysql.
#   - Found a way to make the front-end interact with the back-end
